Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1,562
iii. Category = 2,643
iv. Attribute = 1,115
v. Review = 10,000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10,000
viii. Tip = 537
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2,780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	




3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: (Zero rows)

group by stars
 
 
 
Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns â€“ star rating and count):
+-------+-------+
| stars | count |
+-------+-------+
|   1.5 |    10 |
|   2.5 |     6 |
|   3.5 |    88 |
|   4.0 |    21 |
|   4.5 |    31 |
|   5.0 |     3 |
+-------+-------+
 
ii. Beachwood
 
SQL code used to arrive at answer:
 
select stars, sum(review_count) as count
from business
where city == "Beachwood"
group by stars
 
 
 
Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns â€“ star rating and count):
 
+-------+-------+
| stars | count |
+-------+-------+
|   2.0 |     8 |
|   2.5 |     3 |
|   3.0 |    11 |

|   4.0 |    69 |
|   4.5 |    17 |
|   5.0 |    23 |
+-------+-------+
 
 
7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
 
select id, name, review_count
from user
order by review_count desc
limit 3
 
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
 
select id, name, review_count
from user
order by review_count desc
limit 3
 
		
 
 
8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
 
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
 
Seems like from a glimpse at the output that the review count and the number of fans do not directly correlate with each other. We have instances where a user 2000 reviews has a lot of fans but not too far below we have a user with 377 reviews with half as many fans.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
 
1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes, the 2-3 star businesses appear to have longer hours compared to the 4-5 star businesses based on the query
 
 
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Not really, there appear to be an equal distribution of reviews amongst the 2-3 star businesses and the 4-5 star businesses 
  
  
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Not really, I think it would be more beneficial to have multiple groups by statements using categories amongst different cities and stars and seeing how the distribution is with those groups. 
 
SQL code used for analysis:
select b.name, b.city, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count
from (business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id) inner join hours h on h.business_id = c.business_id
where b.city = 'Toronto'
group by b.stars;
 
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The businesses that are still open tend have more reviews than the ones that are closed
         
ii. Difference 2:
         The businesses that are still open have a higher star rating than the ones that are closed
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select b.is_open, c.category, b.stars, b.review_count
from (business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id) inner join hours h on h.business_id = c.business_id
where b.city = 'Toronto'
group by b.is_open;
 
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
 
Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
The type of analysis that I chose to do is to predict which factors keep a business open and which factors close a business.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
Since the type of analysis I chose to do is based on business factors, the variables I chose to include are the variables that I best believe can judge whether or not a business will close or not. Variables such as the number of reviews, star ratings, and hours of a business can be used to determine how well the business is doing overall and if they’re receiving enough traffic to keep the business going. In addition, the categories the business is labeled under and the attributes can tell the service the business it provides and whether it is popular and can justify the customer flow. The final variable is_open tells us if that business is open or closed.    
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
